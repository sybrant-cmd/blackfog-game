      "Reading this, I’d pause whatever email I was writing. This isn’t background noise – it’s the kind of thing that usually sits at the start of a real incident timeline.",
      "If this landed in my inbox, my first question would be: is this just messy change management, or the first sign that someone is testing how asleep we are at the wheel?",
      "Treat this as the opening scene in a RWS war-room movie. You won’t see the full plot yet, but you can already tell this scene will be referenced later.",
      "The risk here isn’t just the content, it’s the timing and the way it bypasses normal process. That pattern matters more than any single log line.",
      "Ask yourself very simply: if this were nothing, would it really look this coordinated across systems and people?"
    ],
    Detection: [
      "Now the tools are talking. You’re no longer dealing with theory – telemetry is spelling out a story. The question is whether you believe it early or late.",
      "This is where good teams zoom out. Don’t fixate on a single alert; look for the rhythm across endpoints, accounts and time windows.",
      "If this were a complete false positive, you’d expect randomness. What you’re seeing here looks more like a pattern with intent.",
      "Detection is giving you a rough sketch, not a photograph. You have enough shape to act, even if the picture isn’t perfect yet.",
      "The uncomfortable truth is that you rarely get 100% certainty at this stage. You decide on the balance of probability, not perfection."
    ],
    Containment: [
      "Containment is where somebody’s KPI and someone else’s sleep will be affected. That’s why people hesitate – not because the risk is unclear, but because the trade-offs are uncomfortable.",
      "Every containment move spends political capital. The critical question is whether you are spending it early in a controlled way, or later in a crisis.",
      "You almost never have the luxury of a clean, impact-free option. You’re choosing the shape of the pain, not whether there will be any.",
      "Ask yourself: if this gets worse overnight, will you wish you had moved harder and sooner from exactly this point?",
      "A good containment decision is one you can calmly explain to ExCo the next morning using three sentences, not twenty slides."
    ],
    Comms: [
      "This is where technical truth and human reaction intersect. People don’t just want to know what’s happening – they want to know if someone credible is steering.",
      "When you brief upwards, don’t decorate. One sentence on impact, one on what you’re doing, and one on what you don’t know yet beats a long monologue.",
      "If your message sounds defensive, stakeholders will read that as ‘we’ve lost control’. Aim for steady, factual, and specific instead.",
      "The goal here is not to sound heroic, it’s to sound in control: clear status, clear next steps, clear owners.",
      "Remember, silence is also a message. If you don’t provide a narrative, the organisation will happily invent one for you."
    ],
    Recovery: [
      "Recovery is where everyone wants to declare victory and move on. It’s also where many organisations quietly leave the back door half open.",
      "If nothing meaningful changes after this incident, then all we did was run a very stressful fire drill with no learning.",
      "This is the moment to lock in the story: what happened, why it mattered, and what we will concretely do differently next time.",
      "Attackers love environments that celebrate ‘systems are back’ but ignore the root cause. Don’t be that environment.",
      "Think of recovery as the start of the next prevention cycle, not just the end of today’s problem."
    ],
    AggressiveChoice: [
      "You’ve taken the harder line here. That will create noise in the short term, but it sharply limits the attacker’s room to manoeuvre.",
      "This choice tells the organisation that protecting guests and data comes before a quiet day for operations. That’s usually the right story to tell.",
      "You’ve traded some comfort now for less regret later. If this escalates, you’ll be glad you made the tighter call.",
      "Be ready to explain this move in plain language: what you protected, what got disrupted, and why that trade was worth it.",
      "This is a ‘protect the crown jewels first’ decision. Keep your communication as firm as the decision itself."
    ],
    BalancedChoice: [
      "You’ve gone for a middle path – not full lockdown, not full denial. That can work if you’re disciplined about follow-up.",
      "This choice keeps both uptime and security in view. Just be explicit about what risk you are consciously accepting.",
      "The danger with balanced moves is drift. Set a clear time window when you’ll revisit this decision with fresh data.",
      "You’ve tried to buy yourself observation time without fully pulling the plug. Make sure that time is actually used to learn, not to hope.",
      "Write down what new signal would make you tighten this stance. Future you will thank you."
    ],
    ConservativeChoice: [
      "You’ve held back here. That will keep some people comfortable now, but it also gives the attacker more time to explore.",
      "In practice, this shifts risk from operational disruption to potential impact. Be honest with yourself that this is the trade you just made.",
      "If this later turns into a bigger incident, this moment will feature heavily in the timeline. Make sure you’re comfortable defending it.",
      "Sometimes waiting is right – but it should be a deliberate choice, not just a hope that the noise goes away.",
      "If you decide to wait, decide for how long and what exactly you expect to see before you change direction."
    ],
    Default: [
      "Keep your framing simple: protect people, protect data, protect the brand. Most decisions fit inside that triangle.",
      "Future you will likely be writing the incident report. Make decisions that still make sense when the adrenaline has faded.",
      "Good incident handling is more about consistent, explainable decisions than dramatic hero moments.",
      "You don’t need a perfect answer; you need a defendable one delivered at the right time.",

      "Share a one-line summary with your table. Having a common picture reduces noise dramatically.",
      "You don’t have to be dramatic – just be clear and specific about what you see."
